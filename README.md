### Hi there and welcome to my Github Page !

I am a software craftsman for 8 years, passionate developer, spatial data and all kind of geographic software engeneering is my speciality. I developed many projects that involved microservices architecture and Domain/Event Driven Design. Well organized work is a must for me : I use productivity tool for all my tasks and coding issues such as Trello, Jira, Github and Gitlab projects. DevOps tools are also a must for most of my projects and I use Docker, K8s, Travis CI and Jenkins for testing and deploying.
I am alway eager to work on chanllenging tasks. I got strong interpersonal and teamworks skills. 
By the way, I love medieval history and Kendo (Japanese fencing).
